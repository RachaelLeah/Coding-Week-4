<p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk"> Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>
<ol>
<li>HTML is cool SO COOL</li>
<li>CSS is cooler< IVE MADE ANOTHER CHANGE/li>
<li>JS is the best</li>
</ol>

 <h2><em>What do you need to create a website?</em></h2>

Not much!
<ul>
<li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
<li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
<li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
<li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files
</ul></li>
</ul>
